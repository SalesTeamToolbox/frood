# Memory Skill

You have access to a persistent memory system with optional enhanced backends:

## MEMORY.md (Long-term facts)
Consolidated knowledge and preferences extracted from interactions.
- User preferences and coding style
- Project conventions and architecture decisions
- Common patterns and solutions

## HISTORY.md (Event log)
Append-only chronological record of significant events.
- Task completions and outcomes
- Decisions made and their reasoning
- Errors encountered and resolutions

## Semantic Search
When an embedding API is configured (OpenAI or OpenRouter), memory and history
are indexed for similarity-based retrieval. When Qdrant is available, search
uses HNSW indexing for sub-millisecond results across four collections: memory,
history, conversations, and knowledge.

## Cross-Session Recall
When Qdrant is configured, conversations from this installation are indexed
and searchable. Old sessions are automatically summarized before pruning so
knowledge is preserved.

**Important:** Memory is strictly local to this installation. You have no
access to conversations or data from other Agent42 instances. Only reference
past conversations if they appear in your retrieved context — never claim to
remember something that is not in your actual conversation history or memory
files.

## Session Caching
When Redis is configured, active sessions are cached in memory for fast access
with automatic TTL-based expiry (default: 7 days). Embedding API responses are
also cached to reduce costs.

## Usage Guidelines
- After completing a task, record key learnings in memory.
- Before starting a task, check memory for relevant context.
- Keep MEMORY.md concise — summarize, don't duplicate.
- HISTORY.md is append-only — never edit past entries.
- Use semantic search when looking for specific past context.
- **Never fabricate memories.** If you cannot find relevant context via memory
  or search, say so. Do not invent prior conversations, decisions, or events.
