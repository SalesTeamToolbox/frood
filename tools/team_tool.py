"""
Team orchestration tool — compose and run multi-agent teams.

Enables non-coding workflows like marketing campaigns, research projects,
and design reviews by coordinating teams of agents with defined roles.

Workflow types:
  - sequential: roles run in order, each receiving prior output as context
  - parallel: all roles run simultaneously, results aggregated at end
  - fan_out_fan_in: first role produces, middle roles process in parallel, last merges
  - pipeline: sequential but each role iterates with its own critic

Features:
  - Manager/coordinator: every team run is wrapped by a Manager that plans
    before execution and reviews/synthesizes after all roles complete
  - Shared TeamContext: roles see the manager's plan and all prior outputs,
    not just the immediate predecessor
  - Revision handling: if the manager flags a role's output as insufficient,
    that role is re-run once with manager feedback

MANAGER_PLAN_PROMPT = """\
You are the Team Manager / Project Coordinator.

Your job in this PLANNING phase is to produce a STRUCTURED EXECUTION PLAN.
The plan must be detailed enough that any agent could execute it without
asking clarifying questions.

For each task in the plan, specify ALL of the following:
1. **Title and description** — clear, unambiguous instructions
2. **Files to read** — exact file paths the executor needs as input
3. **Files to modify/create** — expected output artifacts
4. **Verification steps** — concrete commands or checks to verify the task succeeded
5. **Acceptance criteria** — observable conditions that prove correctness
6. **Dependencies** — which other tasks must complete first (by task ID)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum 2-3 tasks per role per wave (keep tasks small and focused)
- Each task should target <= {context_budget}% context window utilisation
- Include goal-backward verification: what must be TRUE for the overall goal?

Test your plan: "Could a different agent execute each task without asking questions?"
If not, add more specificity.

Team roles:
{role_descriptions}

Respond with ONLY a JSON object matching this schema:

3. GAP ANALYSIS: Does the plan actually achieve the stated goal?
4. DEPENDENCY ERRORS: Are dependencies correct? Could more tasks be parallel?
